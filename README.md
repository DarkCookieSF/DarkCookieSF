Hi! I'm Dark (@DarkCookieSF), an idiot who likes to make random stuff. I'm intrested in programing. I'm currently trying to learn VB.NET, C#, and Python. I want to collaborate mostly on my Dual98 repository, a dual boot of Windows 98 first and second edition. My favorite animal is a turtle and my favorite color is sky blue 🔵. I'm still in school so don't expect much out of me. I am called annoying daily and people repeat how unfunny I am.
